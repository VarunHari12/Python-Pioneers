Question 1: What is the difference between the string "5" and the int 5?


Question 2: What will the output of following code segment be? Explain the results in steps.

num = input("Give me a positive integer: ")

num = int(num)

for i in range(num):

    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)




Question 3 (this one is a more challenging problem): What will the output of following code segment be? Explain the results in steps.

num1 = 1
while num1 <= 4:
    num2 = 0
    while  num2 <= 3 :
        print(num1*num2, end=" ")
        num2 += 1
    print()
    num1 += 1



Question 4: Please write a program that takes the average of a list of numbers. Then use loops and consitionals to make 2 lists,
one list that contains all numbers above tha average, and one list for all the numbers below the average. Print all 3 lists.


Questions 5 (challenge): Create a number guessing game, (from 1-100), that keeps asking the user for a number until they get the 
number correct. Additionally let them know if they were close. Use this metric to tell them how close they were:

within 5: "Very Close!"
within 10: "Close"
