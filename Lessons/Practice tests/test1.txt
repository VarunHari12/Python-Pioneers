Question 1: What is the difference between the string "5" and the int 5?


Question 2: What will the output of following code segment be? Explain the results in steps.

num = input("Give me a positive integer: ")

num = int(num)

for i in range(num):

    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)




Question 3 (this one is a more challenging problem): What will the output of following code segment be? Explain the results in steps.

num1 = 1
while num1 <= 4:
    num2 = 0
    while  num2 <= 3 :
        print(num1*num2, end=" ")
        num2 += 1
    print()
    num1 += 1



Question 4: Please write a program that takes the average of a list of numbers. Then use loops and consitionals to make 2 lists,
one list that contains all numbers above tha average, and one list for all the numbers below the average. Print all 3 lists.


Questions 5 (challenge): Create a number guessing game, (from 1-100), that keeps asking the user for a number until they get the 
number correct. Additionally let them know if they were close. Use this metric to tell them how close they were:

within 5: "Very Close!"
within 10: "Close"


Q1: The string "5" cant be used for math as it is just considered text. The int 5 can be used for math.

Q2: The user will give a number. That will then be converted to an integer. Using a loop and
a modulus, the loop will print out all of the numbers divisblke by 2

Q3: This will print out the first 4 multiples of the numbers 1-3 using nested loops.

Q4:

list1 = [1,5,3,8,10,2,5,6,2]

sum = 0

for i in list1:
    sum+=i

average = sum/len(list1)
lessList = []
greaterList = []

for i in list1:
    if i < average:
        lessList.append(i)
    elif i> average:
        greaterList.append(i)

print(greaterList)
print(lessList)



Q5:

number = 15

while True:
    guess = input("Guess my number (1-20): ")
    digit = guess.isdigit()

    if digit == True:
        if int(guess) == number:
            print("You got the number correct! ")
            break
        else:
            guess = int(guess)
            if abs(number-guess) <= 5:
                print("Very Close!")
            elif abs(number-guess) <= 10:
                print("Close")
                continue
            else:
                print("You got it incorrect! ")
                continue

    print("please input a digit")
