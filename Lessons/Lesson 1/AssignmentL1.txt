Write a Python program that performs basic mathematical operations. The program should do the following:

Declare two variables, num1 and num2, and assign them integer/float values of your choice.
Declare a variable named result and assign it the value of num1 multiplied by num2.
Print the value of result using the print() statement.
Use the math library to perform the following operations:
a. Declare a variable rounded_result and assign it the rounded value of result.
b. Declare a variable sqrt_result and assign it the square root of result.
c. Declare a variable absolute_result and assign it the absolute value of result.
Print the values of rounded_result, sqrt_result, and absolute_result using the print() statement.


Here is a couple tips on how to do this:

1. Use the print statement method in which you seperate each term with commas ex. print("Square root result:", sqrt_result). This way you can print a combination of different variable types. (remember you can add a string and an integer)
2. use the math functions we used in class (abs,round,math.sqrt)
3. use variables so that you can utilize certain values in different places
