# this is the print statement
# A print statement displays text in the terminal

print("Hello World")


# you can put anything you want in these quotations marks

print("Hi my name is bob")

# you can even print numbers without the quotations marks

print("5")
print(5) # a number with and without quotation marks are a little different

# here is a couple ways to print something

print("Hello World")

print("Hello","World") # envision there is a space in between each comma
print("a","b","c","d","e",sep = "|") # the sep signifies what seperates each term (optional term)
print("result:",13) # you can use values of 2 different types if you use this method

print("Hello" + " World") # combining each term into a full phrase
# using this method you cant add a number and a word "Hello" + 5
