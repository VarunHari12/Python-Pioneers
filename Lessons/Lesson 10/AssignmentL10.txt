Make a python file application

This should be a program that allows a user to write, append, delete, move, copy and read files. 
It should take a user input of a path that a user wants to use (2 files in the case of copy and move) as well
as an input for mode they want to use. 
Then it should perform the operation.

optional: Use except statments to make sure no errors occur
