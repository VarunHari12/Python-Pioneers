Description:
The Magic 8 Ball is a fortune-telling toy that provides answers to yes-or-no questions. In this assignment, you will create a Python program that simulates the Magic 8 Ball's behavior using lists.


1. Create a list named "answers" that contains at least 8 different answers (e.g., "It is certain", "Reply hazy, try again", "Don't count on it", etc.).
2. Display a welcome message and allow the user to ask a question
3. Randomly choose a result from the answers list store it in a variabe named result
4. display result

tips:
use random.choice to get the random value
use the input statement so that the code waits until the the user inputs a question
